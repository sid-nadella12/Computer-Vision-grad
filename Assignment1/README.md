# CV
# Mean Shift segmentation

Mean Shift segmentation technique is used for damping shading or tonality differences for images 


## Platform

Spyder is used for implementing the code.

The file has ".py" extension as it was written in Python 3.6

## Compilation

The image paths must be changed for implementing this Mean Shift 

The input image path should be changed here.

```python
rgb=imageio.imread(r'Image path')
```
The output image path should be changed here
```python
imageio.imwrite('Output path',rgbcb)
```
## Note
The code was tested with 64 * 64 and 128 * 128 size images.

Images with larger size can also be run but will take more time.
