 * Vectors are represented in ANSI C as double*
 * Matrices are stored as vectors in a line by line fashion.
 * i.e., the ij element of a matrix Amxn (m rowns and n columns) is 
 * stored in the i*n+j  position of the vector that stores the 
 * matrix.
 *
 * The ideia is to enable simple matrix creations such as:
   double a[2*3] = {  1., 2., 7.,
                     -1., 5., 4.};
